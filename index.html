  <h2>Lloyd's Corner</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet. You have probably found this through a link on one of my accounts somewhere. Feel free to stay a while and look around.
     I have created this website because I think the internet has lost its way and also to showcase some of the things I have created.
  </p>
  <p>You'll find some links around to various things that I have made and there are also some pages about different ideas I have had and some media and other things that I recommend. I am going to use this page to address my comment on the internet losing its way. I suspect many may question the idea of the internet being able to lose its way. It is just a collection of files after all. What I mean by this is, that when the internet was created I do not believe it was intended for 'content', I think it was for sharing human ideas and art rather than trying to optimise algorithms.  </p>
  <p>Through our attempts to optimise these algorithms we have created other algorithms, in the form of the now ever present AI, that create content. In this process we have taken the human element out of both creation and delivery of ideas. This feels fundamentally wrong to me. So here is my website where I will, in my own time and with no intention of pleasing any of the algorithms that improve click rates, display things that I have created.</p>
  <p>In this quieter part of the internet I intend to also be positive in the things and ideas that I showcase where I can. I believe that these algorithms also encourage the worsts parts of the human elements that are left in the places where they are used. They push divisive topics because they get more engagement, push anger, push hate and push misfortune. I have had enough, as many apps as I can that have content feeds that are driven by algorithms I have deleted. Now I encourage you to do the same and hope that you thank me for it, if not you can always go back.</p>

  <h2>Why Does the Website Look Like That?</h2>
  <p>
    I don't like how modern social media and online spaces force conformity. If you ever go down a internet rabbit hole you can sometimes find some really old and unique websites. Some are bad and some are good but they have their own character. When I made this website I wanted it as a place to express a bit of creativity, I am also learning html and web programming as I go so that might make it a bit rough in places.
