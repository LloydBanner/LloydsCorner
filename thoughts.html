    <p>
        The idea for this page is it will have different ideas that I have had. Some of them may be quite short and simple others may be longer. This is intended to be more of a stream of consciousness and may not be the most refined.
        Sometimes you just have to do something with a thought but you can't think of anything to really do with it. Putting them on this page is a good way to at least do something with them and stop them from troubling me.

    <h3>30/12/2024</h3>
    <p>
        If you read <a href="/LloydsCorner/myBooks.html">Life is Better This Way</a> you may realise I have conflicting thoughts about technology. Even looking around this website will show that. I think it is a powerful tool that can be used in both bad and good ways. To properly use it we should try to find way to incorporate in into our lives unobtrusively I think. This is why I try to go for simple
        home automation projects, they make life easier and once you have implemented them you shouldn't have to think about them. I think this is the ideal way to use technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        What if we took this to the extreme though? If in some distant, or maybe not so distant, future we were able to automate all the menial tasks and jobs. There would still be jobs that needed doing like government and researching and developing new things but most jobs would be redundant. In this world there might still be money but I think we would need either a basic income that everyone gets or anything that we could automate would be free but rationed.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what do all the people do who don't have jobs? As a creative person, I would like to think that given the free time and resources to do what they wanted people would make things. AI art is a pale imitation to human expression and with the free time we could both experience more art and create more. Now I think if people actually did this it would be a utopic world, but I have a feeling that may be somewhat idealistic. Some people may do this, but not everyone is creative and when people get bored they tend to look for other highs.
        Some would certainly resort to drug taking and other indulgences; if this was the case we may end up with a new island of the lotus eaters (An island in Homer's Odyssey where people forget the rest of the world and spend their life eating the narcotic fruits there). 
    </p>
    <p>
        We should carefully evaluate our use of technology and only incorporate it into our lives where it will actually benefit us. We should also be careful and consider the impacts of what we create.
