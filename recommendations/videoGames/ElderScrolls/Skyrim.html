  <h2>Skyrim</h2>
  <h4>
    Masterpiece 
  </h4>
  <p>
    I have hundred of hours playing Skyrim. It has a way of making exploration feel endlessly rewarding that I have only seen in a few games, most notably Dark Souls, Elden Ring and Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
    There are also some great quests like the Daedric Quests and the Dark brotherhood questline.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a game that I come back to every few years though and I like to mix up the experience a bit when I do.
    This game along with maybe <a href="/LloydsCorner/recommendations/videoGames/Minecraft.html">Minecraft</a> has the greatest modding community I have ever seen.
    Personally I like to go with 'lore friendly' mods that add to the experience rather than trying to completely change it.
    I think this is an amazing way to add more to an already great game. There is also a VR version of the game
    which can be good but needs mods to work well in my opinion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bellow I am going to list some of my favorite mods in different categories.

  <p>
    I do not play without a mixture of <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/EnaiSiaion/mods?gameId=1704">EnaiSiaion's</a> mods these days. my favorites are:
    <br>- <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137">Ordinator</a> - This mod completely overhauls Skyrim's perk system allowing you to build far more unique and interesting characters.
    <br>- <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090">Apocalypse</a> - This one adds a tonne of great spells that fit well into Skyrim
    <br>- <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315">Imperious Races</a> - Makes the race you choose have more of an effect on your character and abilities
    <br>- <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14910">Andomeda</a> - Overhauls the bonuses you get from Standing stones
    <br>- <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285">Summermyst</a> - Adds a bunch of new enchantments to the game
    <br> With all of these mods combined you can really mix up the gameplay in Skyrim and create some really varied characters too. Enai also
    has lots more mods such as ones that overhaul vampire and werwolf gameplay, and a few more spell mods too. I recommend browsing their mods page and trying out 
    any that look interesting to you since they are all very well made.
  </p>
  <p>
    For other gameplay stuff here is a quick list:
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015">Honed Metal</a> - Allows smiths and mages to upgrade and enchant your gear respectively so you don't have to do it yourself.

  <p>
    I have played a lot of Skyrim Quest mods, these are my favorites. Some are small some are huge:
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> - Adds in the Northern part of Cyrodill (where Oblivion is set) with a nunch of quests. This is as well made as an offical DLC. This was a teaser to a full Cyrodill release which I am still waiting on.
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179">The Forgotten City</a> - A murder mystery in a lost city, this one got made into a game later.
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996">Project AHO</a> - An underground village where you get abducted and have to try and escape.

    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704">At Your Own Pace</a> - Provides more natural breaks in some quests
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464">Timing is Everything</a> - Adjusts the starting points for a lot of quests and also allows you to tweak them yourself.
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51798">Dungeons Revisited</a> - Overhauls a bunch of dungeons making them longer and more interesting.
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2218">Easyrider's Dungeons</a> - Adds some well made dungeons to the game.
    <br> - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186">Hammet's Dungeons</a> - Another dungeon pack.

    I don't like to go too over the top with graphics. I think the 
    <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/DrJacopo/mods?gameId=1704&sortBy=endorsements">Cathedral Overhauls</a> do a great job.

    There are a few massive mods on their way for Skyrim. The one I am most looking forward to is 
    <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">Skyblivion</a> which is a remake of <a href="Oblicion.html">Oblivion</a> in Skyrim's engine
    with fully updated assets and quests. There are also the 
    <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/">Beyond Skyrim</a> mods which aim to create the rest of Tamriel in Skyrim and allow youto explore beyond the original borders of the game.
    I will be playing any of these as soon as they come out.
