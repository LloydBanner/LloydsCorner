  <h2>Creative Graveyard</h2>
  <p>The video below is called: Your Unfinished Work Defines you. 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@888_crystal">Crystal</a> does a very good job of explaining why you shouldn't always finish your creative work.

  <p>So I have quite a bit of work that I never finished and will never finish. I have decided to use this page to display it. I have added some short explanations for some of it.
  </p>

  <h2>End of an Empire</h2>
  <p>This was a summer project in 2022. I am a big fan of Star Wars, or at least some of it but let's not get into that. There are some great Star Wars video games, which you can see more about in my recommendations, and I wanted to create some software that would unify the single player matches and modes from these games into one campaign a bit like Galactic Conquest in Star Wars Battlefront II (2005).
     The idea was that you could create spaceships and invade planets and when you did it would randomly select relevant locations, games and gamemodes for the encounter. I was quite happy with the results of the code that I wrote, I had planned to make a proper user interface rather than keeping it all command line but when I started playing it wasn't that fun.
     Some of the newer games took a long time to load, different games had more depth and others felt a bit random. I always had the most fun with Star Wars Battlefront II (2005) and found a great mod that allowed you to add user created maps to Galactic Conquest in that game called <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/choose-your-own-galactic-conquest/downloads/choose-your-own-galactic-conquest-2024-edition">Choose your own Galactic Conquest</a>.
     This gave the variety I desired but it would still be nice to have some more variation in gamemodes.
  </p>
  <p>The other problem is that the codebase was becoming quite large and I don't think python was the best language to maintain this.

  <h2>Astray in the Darkmounds</h2>
  <p>After I finished writing <a href="myBooks.html">A Curse Upon Mistrun</a> I tried to keep the momentum going and write another fantasy story, the last edit on this was October 2021. I clearly didn't get very far.
     I had been inspired by recently reading Stephen Fry's retelling of the greek myths with Mythos, Heros and Troy and was planning to have my own pantheon. I found some notes for this one in my obsidian notebook but they were very sparse so I think this one probably comes down to a lack of planning once again.
     I kind of like the concept but the setting feels forcibly dark to me now.

  <h2>Automatic House Lights</h2>
  <p>Some people may call it laziness but I call in convenience. I really like the idea of automating simple tasks in your life so you can focus on more important things.
     The first time I tried to do this was with automated lights for my room in my second year of university in 2019. I used a Raspberry Pi and two PIR sensors and the idea was that by using two sensors you could sense direction rather than just motion.
     With this you could count the people in the room and only have the lights go off when no one was there. I had had enough of annoying lights that would go off while you were still in the room. This worked kind of well but the sensors were somewhat unresponsive and if multiple people came in at once it wouldn't always count them.
     I now use home assistant for automation and find mmWave sensors such as the <a href="https://shop.everythingsmart.io/products/everything-presence-one-kit">EP1</a> or <a href="https://shop.everythingsmart.io/products/everything-presence-lite">EP Lite</a> are much better for detecting presence.

  <h2>Minecraft Mining AI</h2>
  <p>This one I made after watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet">Codebullet</a> videos in December 2018. He did a lot of AI to automate things in games and I wanted to do something similar.
     It is quite difficult to control a game without actually being able to access the game code. I suspect this would have been easier if I had done some image recognition. In the end I didn't really see the point in this because it just removed some of the fun of the game.

  <h2>Space Magic</h2>
  <p>This one was saved in my google drive simply with the name "sci fi story". I it wrote at the start of 2018 probably in my second term of university.
     It was supposed to be a better Star Wars, but I didn't really have a plan other than a few names of people and groups and ultimately I lost motivation.
     After this I wrote <a href="myBooks.html">Crumbling World</a> which I planned fully before beginning and I was much happier with how that turned out although it was much harder sci-fi than this. 
     There is only a couple of chapters if you want to give it a read.
