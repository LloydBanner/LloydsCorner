  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p>I read a book called: "Algorithms to Live by" in my first year of university. It might be considered ironic considering all my anti-algorithm rhetoric on this website but I have chosen to follow some of these algorithms in my life. I think understanding the algorithm and know why you use it removes the negative in this case.
  </p>
  <p>
    The algorithm I think about most is the Explore-Exploit Algorithm, this is essentially weighing up when to use a known good option versus trying something new. I am currently mostly exploring with media and things in general but like to record my favorite things so I can come back and exploit them later. I do however, come back to things that I know I will enjoy occasionally when I need to be happier or just want to relax a little.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here you can find links to recommendations of all my favorite things. Each has a review of what I think is good about it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You won't find scores here but I like to consider things when I revisit them and if they still hold up I will give them a categorisation. If I think they are still incredible they become a masterpiece, in my eyes, if they are still good but not quite a masterpiece I will label them great. Otherwise I may remove a recommendation if I do not like it so much anymore. I try to leave at least 5 years before revisiting and using these labels though.
